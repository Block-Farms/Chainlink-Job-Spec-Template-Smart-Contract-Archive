# Chainlink-Job-Spec-Template-Smart-Contract-Database

What is a Job?
Chainlink nodes require jobs to do anything useful. For example, posting asset price data on-chain requires jobs. Chainlink nodes support the following job types:

Webhook

Direct Request

Flux Monitor

Off-chain Reporting (a.k.a. OCR)

Cron

Keeper

Jobs are represented by TOML (.toml) specifications.
