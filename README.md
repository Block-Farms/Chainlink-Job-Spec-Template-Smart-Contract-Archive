# Chainlink-Job-Spec-Template-Smart-Contract-Database

What is a Job?
Chainlink nodes require jobs to do anything useful. For example, posting asset price data on-chain requires jobs. Chainlink nodes support the following job types:

[Webhook](https://docs.chain.link/docs/jobs/types/webhook/)

[Direct Request](https://docs.chain.link/docs/jobs/types/direct-request/)

[Flux Monitor](https://docs.chain.link/docs/jobs/types/flux-monitor/)

[Off-chain Reporting (a.k.a. OCR)](https://docs.chain.link/docs/jobs/types/offchain-reporting/)

[Cron](https://docs.chain.link/docs/jobs/types/cron/)

[Keeper](https://docs.chain.link/docs/jobs/types/keeper/)

Jobs are represented by TOML (.toml) specifications.
